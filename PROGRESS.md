# Morrow build — PROGRESS

Read this first on resume. Source of truth for scope: `PRD.md` v4.1 (§7 features, §10 stack, §11 AI, §14 plan).
Companions: The Authoring Script (every prompt), the Flow Atlas (every flow), the Studio canvas (design).

## Ground rules for the build
- The user writes every goal, plan line and Book sentence. AI only asks, quotes (verified substrings), sorts, typesets.
- Choices first, writing last. Honest time. Starter/Full depth tracks.
- Studio design system: stones, sockets, rings, hold-to-seal, Outfit + Newsreader.
- Local-first; the app must work fully offline for the Interview, the Fifteen, the stones, the Book and Today.
- No account/keys exist in this environment: Supabase, Anthropic, fal, RevenueCat are behind adapters with deterministic local fallbacks. Real providers are wired but untested until keys are supplied (see "Blocked on the user").

## Status
- [x] 0. Toolchain check, monorepo scaffold (pnpm workspaces, apps/mobile Expo, packages/core, packages/ui, supabase/)
- [x] 1. packages/core: domain model, stores (zustand + persist), engines: interview bank, readback (local fallback + AI adapter), specificity check, portrait/blueprint builders from user lines, consistency score, returns, book renderer model
- [x] 2. packages/ui: Studio tokens, Stone/Socket/Ring (react-native-svg), HoldBar, Chip, Field, Sheet, text primitives
- [x] 3. apps/mobile screens (all 16 routes; Bench/Quarry/Envision are Phase 2/3): Welcome, Consent, Interview, Authoring opening, the Fifteen, What I heard, Rank/Title, Analysis sheet, Seal the Book, Book, Portrait, Blueprint, Today (+gestures), Seal the day, Coach, Envision, Settings, Paywall
- [x] 4. Tests: 65 vitest unit tests + 33 Playwright e2e checks, all green
- [ ] 5. supabase/: migrations (§10.3), edge functions (readback, portrait, blueprint, brief, coach-chat, safety), RLS
- [ ] 6. Hardening: error states, offline, safety screen, export/delete, accessibility labels
- [ ] 7. Research pass: libraries/versions; improvements; repeat

## In flight
- Next: supabase/ (migrations + edge functions), then the hardening pass.

## How to run it
```
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @morrow/core test          # 65 unit tests
cd apps/mobile && npx expo export --platform web --output-dir dist
node scripts/e2e.mjs                     # 33 end-to-end checks, serves dist itself
cd apps/mobile && npx expo start         # device/simulator
```

## Done in detail
- **Workspace**: pnpm 11 workspaces, TS 5.9 strict (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), vitest. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` carries `onlyBuiltDependencies` (pnpm 11 moved settings out of package.json).
- **packages/core** (`@morrow/core`), 65 tests green:
  - `types.ts` domain + zod, `ids.ts` (sortable offline ids, `dayOf` honours the 3am day boundary)
  - `engines/interview.ts` tap-only state machine, 6 areas x 4 branches + custom areas, clarity, seeds
  - `engines/specificity.ts` deterministic time/place/number/cadence check earning ONE follow-up
  - `engines/framings.ts` the framing bank (5 kinds, per-domain questions, full-track prompts)
  - `engines/readback.ts` local span extractor + `verifySpans` (the substring gate)
  - `engines/portrait.ts`, `engines/blueprint.ts` (`validatePlan` requires `sourceLineId` on every move)
  - `engines/book.ts` (`authorshipRatio`, `SealRefused`, diff, text export)
  - `engines/consistency.ts` (EWMA 28d, returns, almanac), `engines/writing.ts` (the Fifteen), `engines/coach.ts`, `engines/safety.ts`
  - `ai/provider.ts`: `LocalProvider`, `AnthropicProvider`, and `guarded()` which enforces the rules on ANY provider
- **packages/ui** (`@morrow/ui`): Studio tokens (day + night studio), `Stone` and `Socket` (SVG so they render on every target incl. the web build the e2e drives), `Ring` (single or segmented), `HoldBar` (the 1.6s hold, drains on early release, and an accessibility tap for people who cannot hold), `UserText` (the ONLY serif in the product — if a screen wants to render app prose as the user's words, it cannot), Chip/InkButton/UserField/Toast/EmptyState.
- **apps/mobile**: Expo SDK 57 + Router, 16 routes: Welcome, Consent, Interview, Authoring opening (depth question), the Fifteen (ring, seeds, idle nudges, voice/type modes), What I heard, Rank + title, the analysis stone (used 12×), Seal the Book, the Book (paper page), Today (stones, drag-to-park, Now card, consistency), Seal the day, Coach, Goal, Settings (export + delete). Store is zustand + AsyncStorage; `guarded(LocalProvider)` means the whole flow works offline.
- **Bugs found by tests and fixed**: (1) the first move was the first one *named* rather than the *soonest*, so a "Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday" line put the first move 6 days out and failed the 48h rule; moves are now date-sorted. (2) `authorshipRatio` counted fixed framing labels as rival authorship and refused legitimate short Books; it now measures user prose vs a `generated` slot. (3) the safety category regex missed inflected forms ("bingeing").
- **Bugs found by the end-to-end run and fixed**: (4) zustand v5 compares selector results by reference, so `activeGoals` building a fresh array each call crashed the app with React error #185 (infinite render) the moment a second screen used it — all derived selectors now go through `useShallow`. (5) `todaysMoves` only showed moves dated today or earlier, so Today was empty on the evening you seal the Book (the first move is dated tomorrow); it now brings the next upcoming move forward. (6) `splitFirstMoves` left the other weekday names in every title ("Thursday: Thursday, Saturday at 6:40…"); the day names now become the schedule and leave the body. (7) the Interview and What I heard both created goals, so naming a span the same thing produced duplicates; `addGoals` now merges by name. (8) the safety card used an RN Modal that painted above its own dismiss button on web, and a `flex:1` container that collapsed the card so the button fell outside it — the last control a person in trouble touches was the most fragile one. Rewritten as a plain overlay that sizes to its content, with the button outside the scroll view.

## Blocked on the user
- Supabase project URL/anon key, Anthropic API key, fal.ai key, RevenueCat keys: needed to test real providers. Everything runs on local fallbacks without them.

## Decisions log
- 2026-09-09: start. Stones via react-native-svg (works on web for Playwright tests) rather than Skia; Skia can replace later for grain.
- 2026-09-09: local store = zustand + AsyncStorage persistence for Phase 1 speed; SQLite/Drizzle migration is a hardening step once screens exist.

## Next steps
1. packages/ui: tokens + Stone/Socket/Ring/HoldBar/Chip/Field/Sheet/text.
2. apps/mobile: Expo Router screens, zustand store on top of core.
3. supabase/ migrations + edge functions behind the existing adapter.
4. Hardening pass: offline states, error boundaries, a11y sweep.
5. Research pass on libraries and current practice; then loop.
